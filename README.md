# MAFIA

### A multi-player game with integrated video-conferencing, based on the popular game Mafia.

On our multi-player web app, you can enjoy a game of Mafia with your friends, wherever they are in the world! The computer acts as the 'host', assigning roles, taking votes and delivering outcomes. With integrated video conferencing, players can interact throughout the game.

Our game's stack is built on Sequelize and Express for the back end, and React-Redux for the front end. We utilized the socket.io library to manage the live stream of data between players. We also incorporated OpenTok for video conferencing to include the most important aspect of the original game - seeing each other face to face.
